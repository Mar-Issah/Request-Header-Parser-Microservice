# Request Header Parser Microservice

A simple web app to display my skills in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (Node.js with Express).

## About The Project

![Timestamp Microservice](https://res.cloudinary.com/dytnpjxrd/image/upload/v1617756559/My%20Website%20Projects/header_parser_ug3te7.png)

This is a Node. js (with Express. js) little application which is part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Back End Certification. It takes a string "whoami" and gives you back a JSON with IP address, preferred language and browser software.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started
Using it on your local machine.
### Prerequisites
You need to have Node, yarn and npm installed on your machine. To check if they are installed, open up a terminal window and type the following:
 ```sh
npm -v
yarn -v
node -v
   ```
   
If these commands print out a version number in the terminal, you are good to go. If not, you need to go ahead and install what is missing. For the purpose of this project, I used [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo on your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mar-Issah/Request-Header-Parser-Microservice-FCC.git
   ```
2. Change directory into the new folder and type the following, this installs the required dependencies.
    ```sh
    npm install
   ```
3. To run the React project.
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
